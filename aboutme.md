I am currently a Research Associate at Search Based planning Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University. I work on developing motion planning algorithms for different types of robots from autonomous vehicles to manipulators to snake bots.

Obtained my Masters in Mechanical Engineering (Research) from Carnegie Mellon University (supervised by [Dr. Maxim Likhachev](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/) and [Dr. Kenji Shimada] (https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/shimada-kenji.html) and my Bachelors from Delhi Technological University.
