My major interest lies in the field of Motion Planning and Control of autonomous bots. Some other fields of interest are Computer Vision and Deep Learning. <br/>

Most of my research work has been in the field of Search Based motion planning as I have been a part of [Search Based Planning Laboratory](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/search-based-planning-laboratory/) at CMU for the past year.

Some of my research Projects and Publication are

## **[Learning to Use Adaptive Motion Primitves in Search-Based Motion Planning](research/iros_2020/iros_2020.md)**

This work was recently accepted for [International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)](https://www.iros2020.org/) 2020 which will be held on October 25, 2020.

In this work we provide an algorithm that intelligently activates *Adaptive Motion Primitives* using Deep Learning for motion planning in navigation domain using Heuristic-based graph search algorithms like A* .Our experiments shows that our approach can lead to upto 2x speedup in planning times.
