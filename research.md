My major interest lies in the field of Motion Planning and Control of autonomous bots. Some other fields of interest are Computer Vision and Deep Learning. <br/>

Most of my research work has been in the field of Search Based motion planning as I have been a part of [Search Based Planning Laboratory](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/search-based-planning-laboratory/) at CMU for the past year.
